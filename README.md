# GreenDevList

List of ideas to make your project more sustainable

> Just getting started here! Send me a PR to add ideas or open an issue to discuss them!!

## The Plan

- Grow a list of ideas organically and over time
- Add details where feasible
- Point to external resources when viable

## The List

- Allow for a dark mode option
- Remove unused resources
- Make it a metric you care about and track (like cost)
- Include emissions as a design point when building/refactoring
- Make your app smaller
- Reduce network traffic transmission distance
- Make non-time specific workloads aware of when it is greener to run
- Always auto-scale
